# 2. Get Started

Download the Repository, unzip if needed and put it into an arbitrary folder.

First and foremost, make sure you install the necessary dependencies using (yarn or npm) from the downloaded project directory.

```
npm install
```

In the project directory, you can now run

```
npm run start
```

This will start the project in development mode available at http://localhost:3000 with live reload (thanks to create-react-app).

You can also build the project into a static website for deployment if you choose to.

```
npm run build
```

# 3. Have fun with our awesome app :)
